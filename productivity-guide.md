Even though we are sure about something, let us give some room for discussion by
asking a question.

##### _Email etiquette_

See https://www.grammarly.com/blog/how-to-end-an-email/

#### Privacy

##### _Mail address_

Make sure to have a different email addresss for Open Source discussion with a pseudony, such
for example, **corepointer** or **j143**. So that email address can be `j143 [at] protonmail.com`.

##### _Full name_

Full name of a person is to be kept private.

1. If you are using Gmail, navigate to https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#settings/accounts.

2. In the `edit info` section, you might want to remove your second name! :)
