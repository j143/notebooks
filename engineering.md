#### Engineering

##### It all starts with a Pull Request (PR)

An effective way to make a change to the project is to make a proposal in
the form of a pull request against the `master` branch. Start with a small changeset
and add [WIP] tag to the PR and ask for preliminary review at first to decide upon the
correct direction.

##### Code authoring and review practices

Let us follow the same guide used by Apache Spark and Google Engineering teams.
see https://google.github.io/eng-practices.

##### Refactoring (code or documentation)

On any given day we work on the code and parallely modify the previously working code
for better maintenance and internal structure which we normally call as refactoring.

>What is *Refactoring*?
>
>It is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its
internal structure without changing its external behaviour.

##### Keep informed

As a par of a full distributed organization (i.e., people in different timezones), it is
important to stay informed about engineering-led initiatives.
